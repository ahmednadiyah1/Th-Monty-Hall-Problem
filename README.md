# The-Monty-Hall-Problem
The Monty Hall Problem is a probability puzzle loosely based on the Americal television game show, "Let's Make a Deal" and named after it's host, Monty Hall. 
Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

The secret is that the contestant should switch to the other door. Under the standard assumptions, the switching strategy has a 2/3 probability of winning the car, while the strategy that remains with the initial choice has only a 1/3 probability.

Now this particular program is a twist on the original Monty Hall Problem. Here you can choose the number of trials as well as the number of doors you want to play with. For example, you have the choice to go through the game with 100 foors and 3 trails or 10 doors and 9 trials. 

The program also calculates the average probablity of the whole problem based on the number of trails and number of doors chosen by you.
